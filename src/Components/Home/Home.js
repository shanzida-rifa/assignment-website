            <h5>
                The more you use your brain to learn new skills, the more your brain’s functions work. Learning a new language pushes your brain to get familiar with new grammar and vocabulary rules. It allows you to train your memory to remember new words, make connections between them, and use them in contextual situations

            <h1>What languages are the most useful to learn? Middlebury Language Schools recommends 3 of our 12 languages</h1>
            <h5>Since 1915, Middlebury Language Schools has been one of the nation’s preeminent language learning programs.

                Whether you’re a beginning language learner or working toward an advanced degree, our time-tested programs offer a range of options and opportunities.

                Taking the Language Pledge at Middlebury Language Schools means committing to communicate only in the language of your choice for the duration of the program. You will live, play, and learn in a 24/7 environment.

                We offer a wide range of languages you can choose from. Here are just a few of the languages we offer.

                The Russian language is not very closely related to English due to many geopolitical reasons. It is a very challenging language to learn, with complex grammar and syntax rules. However, it is an extremely culturally and politically relevant language.

                At the Russian Language School, you can experience the most effective method for rapid language acquisition. An immersion environment is a promise that you will read, write, speak, and listen only in Russian throughout the duration of the program.

                Some of the benefits of learning Russian at Middlebury Language Schools include interpreting poetry, learning about the culture, and mastering the Russian etiquette. Check out more about the Russian program options here!

                Arabic has been one of our most popular languages. It is a high demand language because it can get you ahead in a government career, but also give you endless opportunities in business and international relations.

                Arabic is spoken by more than 300 million people and is one of the top 5 most spoken languages in the world. Learning Arabic as a second language can help you learn about the Arabic culture and religion.

                It not only gives you opportunities to expand your connections, but also offers great travel opportunities.

                A summer at the Arabic Language School will help you experience the immersive environment on campus or during online classes. At Middlebury Language Schools, the focus is on Modern Standard Arabic, with optional Arabic language classes in dialects such as Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan. Check our Arabic graduate programs and Arabic 8-week immersion program for more information.

                A lot of people agree that Spanish is one of the easiest languages to learn, due to the fact that you read words as they are written. Spanish is the most spoken language in the world after English and is used by more than 400 million people.

                Spanish skills can be a strong asset for communicating and creating relationships not only in Spain, but also in Latin America.

                At the Middlebury Spanish Language School, you can engage your mind with topics of interest, from Spanish history to arts and cooking.
