                        We usually go there for practicing English. It helps people to learn different languages. It helps us to communicate with the foreigners. I think a language club plays a vital role for all the people. We listen to CD, watch movies on DVD or practice speaking the language. The importance of the language club is obviously great. It makes easy to learn foreign language. So a language club is very important for us.</p>
